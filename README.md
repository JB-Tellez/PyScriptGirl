### Editor Warnings

Your code editor will complain about `pyiodide` and `pyscript` being unrecognized.

This is because your editor is living in the old world. You are living in the new one where Python runs in the browser.

So just ignore those particular red squigglies. As long as it runs in browser you are all good.
